Just remember the fact that child absuers and people that target victims of child abuse:
- deserve the international human rights abuse death penalty, for child-abuse-human-right-abuse if they step foot outside of Australia
- should not have positions of authority is a civilised society
- targeting victims increases the serverity of required punishment for them and people who support them
- people who label child abuse victims as 'pushovers' deserve especially cruel deaths
- uniforms (poice or military) do not excuse them from international child abuse death penalties, where they are undeniably guilty
- execution of all people involved in child abuse is morally appropriate if all other avenues for fairness and justice have been exhuasted
- human rights abusers who victim blame deserve nothing but death
- International Human Rights Laws clearly dont apply to anyone involved in revenge agaisnt my wife and I overseas and in Australia
- under the 'Nuremberg Protocol' they would be hanged for human rights abuses agaisnt civilians
- adults who bully underage kids are assholes

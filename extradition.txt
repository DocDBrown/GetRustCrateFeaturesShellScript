Ministry of Justice, Kingdom of Cambodia
Sothearos Boulevard, Phnom Penh, Cambodia 

Subject: Request to initiate criminal proceedings and seek international cooperation (including extradition, if available) concerning alleged stalking, intimidation, and sexual harassment of my wife and me during our 2014 visit to Cambodia

Your Excellency,

I write to respectfully submit a formal complaint and to request that the competent Cambodian authorities (including the Prosecutor’s Office and/or an Investigating Judge) open a criminal case concerning conduct committed against my wife Amie Walker and myself Duncan Brown while we were tourists in Cambodia in 2004. The suspects are believed to be members of the University of Queensland Army Medical Officers - graduating years 2004-2006, with identities currently partially known.

1. Summary of alleged conduct

During our holiday in Cambodia January 2014, in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, including at/near ‘Temple Club’ Siem Reap, we experienced repeated and escalating conduct including:

- Stalking/being followed in Cambodia in January 2014 consistent with criminal stalking under Cambodian and Australian law;
- Intimidation and threats directed at us, including attempted murder in Australia and threatening violence in Cambodia; and joking about doing ‘CIA kill order’ on their own civilian tourists over personal vendettas
- Sexual harassment of my wife, including their plans and credible threats to assault me and rape her while in Cambodia

This conduct caused fear, distress, and has resulted in 10 years of psychological torture in Australia consistent with breaching Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court and resulted in extreme psychological and physical injury against my wife and I (post traumatic stress disorder)

2. Legal characterisation (for investigation and appropriate charging)

Without limiting the authorities’ discretion, the conduct described above appears capable of amounting to offences under Cambodian law, including:

- Threat offences under Chapter 3 “Threats” (Penal Code Articles 231–234), as applicable to the facts (including repeated threats; threats made with an order/condition; repeated death threats; and death threats made with an order/condition).
- Privacy-related offences under Title 6 “Infringement on a Person”, Chapter 1 “Infringement on Privacy”, including: (i) Listening or Recording Private Speeches (Article 301); and/or (ii) Infringement on the Right of Private Picture (Article 302), if supported by evidence.
- Sexual harassment (Penal Code Article 250) **only if** the facts satisfy the statutory elements—i.e., abuse of power vested by the perpetrator’s functions to put pressure again and again in exchange for sexual favour; otherwise, the competent authorities may consider other offences that better fit the conduct.

In addition their offenses are consistent with stalking, intimidation, defmation, aggrivated child abuse retribution and serious criinal vilifcation of aminor under Australian law, although due to Australian courrption they are unlikely to face justice in Australia. Their actions are consistent with clear breach of article 7 of the Rome Statue agaisnt their own civilians

3. Limitation periods (request for assessment)

I understand that Cambodia’s Code of Criminal Procedure provides limitation periods for bringing criminal action of 15 years for felonies, 5 years for misdemeanours, and 1 year for petty offences, subject to rules on interruption and other legal conditions. 
Because the events occurred in 2014, I respectfully request a formal legal assessment of whether:
- any alleged offences qualify as felonies and whether limitation has expired;
- limitation was interrupted (e.g., by any accusation/investigation) or whether any relevant conduct is legally continuing; and
- any alternative lawful avenues remain available in Cambodia.

4. Request to proceed as victim / civil party and to obtain a case reference

If permissible, I request to be recognised as a victim of International crime by Australian Army Officers in Cambodia (and, if required/available, to proceed as a civil party) and to receive written confirmation of:

- the case number/reference,
- the assigned prosecutor/jurisdiction, and
- any required deposit, formalities, translations, or notarizations.

I note that the Code of Criminal Procedure provides mechanisms for a victim to act as a civil party and for petitions to be handled through an investigating judge and prosecutor processes. 

5. Request for international cooperation, including extradition if legally available

If Cambodian authorities determine that prosecution is legally possible and supported by evidence, I respectfully request that Cambodia pursue international cooperation to identify and secure the suspects, including:

- requesting formal assistance from Australian authorities to identify the individuals (including via relevant institutions), locate them, and preserve evidence; and
- seeking extradition to Cambodia where lawful and appropriate.

I understand that Australia processes extradition in accordance with the Extradition Act 1988 and can only accept requests from a country declared an extradition country under domestic regulations. The Australian parliamentary record notes that Extradition (Kingdom of Cambodia) Regulations 2003 declare Cambodia to be an extradition country. I also understand Australia participates in non-treaty arrangements based on reciprocity with countries including Cambodia and that the Attorney-General is responsible for extradition in Australia.

6. Suspect identification information (if known)

Group: University of Queensland Army Medical Officers - graduating years 2004-2006
Australian addresses/employers unknown

7. Requested outcome

I respectfully request that the Ministry of Justice:

1. Refer this complaint to the competent prosecutorial/judicial authority to determine whether a criminal case can be opened in Cambodia;
2. Initiate an investigation and take witness statements;
3. Issue lawful warrants/requests where appropriate; and
4. Engage Australian counterparts for identification, evidence-gathering, and extradition (if available), or any other lawful mechanism to ensure accountability. Recognising that corrupt Australian police state representatives want to cover up the crimes committed ageists their own civilians 

I make this report in good faith and will cooperate fully with Cambodian authorities. Please inform me of the next procedural steps and any documentation requirements (including Khmer translations).

Respectfully,



Dr Duncan Alexander Brown
